This program reads a file that contains a model
of a transition system, parses the file,
grounds the specification, and finally translates
it into a formula in the propositional logic.
The grounded specification as well as the formula
are printed to the standard output.

To run the program you need

  Python 3.x
  PLY, which is a parser/lexer tool for Python
  tulip / dd

To install these in some Linux variants (e.g. Ubuntu), write

  sudo apt-get install python3 python3-ply
  pip3 install dd

To run the BDD-based reachability analyzer write e.g.

  python3 bddreachability.py SETBITS10.SPEC
