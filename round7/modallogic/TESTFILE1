# A Kripke model is specified by listing all worlds in it, and for each world
# the set of atomic propositions that are TRUE in it (and the rest are FALSE),
# and finally listing all the worlds that are accessible. The description of
# each world is terminated by a semicolon.
#
# In this example, we interpret worlds as persons, accessibility relation as
# the "has friend" relation, so that NECE phi means "all friends have property phi"
# and POSS phi means "at least one friend has property phi".
