# Here is a dummy Kripke model, with five worlds, all atomic propositions
# false in all worlds, and no accessible worlds for any world.

 w1 {c, b} w4;
 w2 {a} w3;
 w3 {a,b,c} w0;
 w4 {b, c} w3;

# Your task is to extend the model so that all of the following formulas
# are true in the Kripke model.

a and b;

POSS (not a and b);

POSS not b;

POSS NECE (a and b);

POSS NECE (not a);

NECE NECE c;
